## Issues planned for Sprint 1

- Login screen implementation for the front end
- Basic user database for the backend

## What was successfully completed
Backend: 
- Learning basics of Go
- Learning about and implementing basic Rest API functions with CRUD (creating, reading, updating, and deleting a "user") features in our SQL database, using Gorilla Mux for routing and Gorm for ORM
- Connecting to a database in MySQL, creating an SQL database, making a table with user's information, learning how to customize the table's schema to add additional details that can be updated after the initialization of the username, password, and biography fields.

Frontend:
- Home page with navbar and other UI components
- Angular Routing set up to other pages
- Contact info form set up (submit does not yet function)
## What was not successfully completed and why?
Backend: 
- Making the Rest API requests use variables and create a working system where HTTP requests from the frontend can be processed for a working login
  - We could not complete this because we had trouble understanding how to connect Angular and Go. We also need to better understand how to further implement the Rest API to update the remainder of the user information once users progress to the profile page on our application. 

Frontend:
- Login system
  - We wanted to figure out connection with the backend before implementing the login system. However, we were not able to get this working before Sprint 1.

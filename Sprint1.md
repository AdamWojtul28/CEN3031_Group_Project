## Issues planned for Sprint 1

- Login screen implementation for the front end
- Basic login database for the backend

## What was successfully completed
Backend: 
- Learning basics of go
- Learning and implementing basic rest api functions such as updating, creating, and deleting a "user" in our SQL database
- Creating an SQL database and making a table with user's information

Frontend:
- Home page with navbar and other UI components
- Angular Routing set up to other pages
- Contact info form set up (submit does not yet function)
## What was not successfully completed and why?
Backend: 
- Making the rest api requests use variables and create a working system where http requests from the frontend can be processed for a working login
  - We could not complete this because we had trouble understanding how to connect angular and go. We also need a better understanding of rest api

Frontend:
- Login system
  - We wanted to figure out connection with the backend before implementing the login system. However, we were not able to get this working before Sprint 1.
